### GPT as a Markov State Machine with REINFORCE

---

### 1. GPT as a Markov Chain over Tokens

A causal Transformer can be reframed as a **Markov process**:

* **State:** the sequence of tokens up to step $t$, $s_t = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t)$.
* **Transition:** the probability distribution over the next token, parameterized by $\theta$:

  $$
  P_\theta(x_{t+1} \mid s_t) = \text{softmax}(f_\theta(s_t))
  $$
* **Markov Property:**

  $$
  P(x_{t+1} \mid s_t) = P(x_{t+1} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_t)
  $$

  GPT enforces this by conditioning only on the causal prefix.

Thus, the Transformer acts as a **probabilistic state machine**: each state corresponds to a token sequence, and transitions are next-token probabilities.

---

### 2. AEON Extension: States Beyond Tokens

With AEON, the **state machine expands**:

$$
z_t = (s_t, \theta_t, a_t, h_t, M_t, r_t, m_t)
$$

* **Token state:** sequence $s_t$.
* **Parameter state:** $\theta_t$.
* **Adaptive coefficients:** $a_t$.
* **Optimizer memory:** $h_t$.
* **External memory:** $M_t$.
* **Resonance state:** $r_t, m_t$.

This creates a **Markov decision process (MDP)**, not just a chain: the next state depends on both tokens and adaptive dynamics.

---

### 3. Reinforcement Formulation

We can reinterpret training with **policy gradient (REINFORCE)**:

* *
* *Policy:**

  $$
  \pi_\theta(x_{t+1} \mid s_t) = P_\theta(x_{t+1} \mid s_t)
  $$

* **Trajectory:**

  $$
  \tau = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T)
  $$

* **Return (reward):**

  * Cross-entropy training: reward = log-likelihood.
  * RLHF or AEON extension: reward = preference, stability, novelty.

* **REINFORCE gradient:**

  $$
  \nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}\!\left[ \sum_t R_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(x_t \mid s_{t-1}) \right]
  $$

This aligns directly with GPT training if $R_t = 1$ and reward is negative log-likelihood.

---

### 4. AEON as REINFORCE Regulator

* Resonance $m_t$ modifies **effective rewards**:

  * Novelty → amplify gradient (more plastic).
  * Stability → damp gradient (more conservative).

* Adaptive coefficients $a_t$ act as **learned baselines**, reducing variance of REINFORCE.

* Memory $M_t$ enables **credit assignment across time**, replaying past states for stabilized learning.

---

### 5. Theory Summary

* **GPT baseline:** a **Markov chain over tokens**.
* **Training:** equivalent to REINFORCE with reward = log-likelihood.
* **AEON extension:** lifts GPT into an **MDP** with richer state including adaptive memory, resonance, and coefficient evolution.
* **Learning dynamics:** policy gradients modulated by resonance law, stabilizing the stability–plasticity dilemma.

AEON-GPT as a formal state-space model.

## 1) Objects

* Tokens: $x_t \in \mathcal{V}$.
* Prefix state: $s_t = (x_1,\dots,x_t)$.
* AEON internal state: $u_t = (\theta_t, a_t, h_t, M_t, r_t, m_t)$.
* Full state: $z_t = (s_t, u_t)$.
* Action: $a^{\text{tok}}_t = x_{t+1}$.
* Policy: $\pi_{\theta_t}(x_{t+1}\mid s_t)$.

## 2) Observation and emission

$$
o_t = s_t,\qquad
x_{t+1} \sim \pi_{\theta_t}(\cdot\mid s_t) = \mathrm{softmax}(f_{\theta_t}(s_t)).
$$

## 3) Resonance attention (differentiable)

Let base attention logits be $\ell_{ij}$ (per head). Gate by resonance:

$$
g_t = \sigma\!\big(\alpha (m_t-\tau)\big),\quad
\kappa_t = (1-g_t)\,\kappa_{\text{stable}} + g_t\,\kappa_{\text{plastic}},
$$

$$
\tilde{\ell}_{ij} = \kappa_t \,\ell_{ij},\qquad
A = \mathrm{softmax}(\tilde{\ell}) .
$$

## 4) AEON dynamics

Loss at step $t$: $L_t = -\log \pi_{\theta_t}(x_{t+1}^\star\mid s_t)$ for MLE, or any task loss.

Resonance EMA:

$$
m_{t+1} = \rho\, m_t + (1-\rho)\, \phi(L_t),\quad \rho\in(0,1).
$$

Recurrence state (optional linear cell):

$$
r_{t+1} = \Gamma r_t + \Psi \,\bar{h}_t,
$$

where $\bar{h}_t$ is a pooled hidden state from the Transformer.

Adaptive coefficients (γ-law, σ-law example):

$$
a_{t+1} = a_t + \eta_a \,\gamma(m_t, \nabla L_t, \text{stats}(M_t)),\qquad
\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2(m_t)),\ \ \sigma(m)=\sigma_0 + \sigma_1 g_t.
$$

Optimizer memory (e.g., Adam moments):

$$
h_{t+1} = \mathcal{U}_{\text{opt}}(h_t, \nabla_{\theta_t} L_t; a_t).
$$

Parameters (online update; generic form):

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)\,\widehat{\nabla_{\theta_t} L_t} + \epsilon_t.
$$

Memory evolution:

$$
M_{t+1} = \mathcal{U}_M(M_t;\ \text{summaries}(s_t,\bar{h}_t,L_t,m_t))\ \ \text{(e.g., reservoir or EMA stats)}.
$$

Token prefix:

$$
s_{t+1} = (s_t, x_{t+1}).
$$

Joint transition:

$$
z_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{T}(z_t) \equiv
\Big(s_{t+1},\ u_{t+1}\Big)
$$

with components defined above.

## 5) Control signal as reward shaping

Define per-step reward $R_t$ for RL views.

* MLE: $R_t = \log \pi_{\theta_t}(x_{t+1}^\star\mid s_t)$.
* RLHF or tasks: $R_t = r_{\text{task}}(s_t,x_{t+1}) - \lambda_{\text{stab}} \psi(m_t) + \lambda_{\text{nov}} \chi(1-m_t)$.

AEON shaping via resonance:

$$
\tilde{R}_t = b(a_t,M_t) + \omega(m_t)\,R_t,
$$

where $b$ is a learned baseline and $\omega(m)$ is monotone in novelty.

## 6) Learning rules

### 6.1 MLE (teacher forcing)

$$
\nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_t \nabla_{\theta} \big(-\log \pi_{\theta}(x_{t+1}^\star\mid s_t)\big)\right],
$$

with on-line updates via $\eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)$ and gated attention.

### 6.2 REINFORCE

$$
\nabla_\theta J = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\!\left[\sum_t (\tilde{R}_t - b_t)\,\nabla_\theta \log \pi_{\theta}(x_{t+1}\mid s_t)\right].
$$

AEON reduces variance via $b_t=b(a_t,M_t)$ and adapts step size via $\eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)$.

### 6.3 Actor-Critic (optional)

Critic $V_\psi(s_t,u_t)$ with TD loss

$$
\mathcal{L}_V = \big(R_t + \gamma V_\psi(z_{t+1}) - V_\psi(z_t)\big)^2.
$$

Actor uses advantage $A_t = R_t + \gamma V_\psi(z_{t+1}) - V_\psi(z_t)$ inside REINFORCE. AEON modulates both via $m_t$.

## 7) Special cases and consistency

* If $a_t, h_t, M_t, r_t, m_t$ are fixed and $\theta$ updates only by standard SGD, AEON-GPT reduces to a standard GPT trained by MLE.
* If sampling replaces teacher forcing and reward comes from a preference model, this is sequence-level RL with AEON shaping.

## 8) Differentiability and stability

* All updates are smooth if $\sigma,\gamma,\psi,\chi,\omega$ are smooth and gating uses the sigmoid form.
* Stability–plasticity is set by $\tau,\alpha,\kappa_{\text{stable}},\kappa_{\text{plastic}},\rho$.
* Lyapunov-style criterion: choose $\eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)$ and $\rho$ to keep $m_t$ within a bounded attractor; use EMA memory statistics to cap variance of $\widehat{\nabla L_t}$.

## 9) Minimal algorithm (online)

1. Observe $s_t$. Compute logits with gated attention using $m_t$.
2. Sample or teacher-force $x_{t+1}$. Compute $L_t$ or $R_t$.
3. Update $h_t,a_t,m_t,r_t,M_t$. Compute gradient and update $\theta_t$ with $\eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)$ and optional noise $\epsilon_t$.
4. Append token to form $s_{t+1}$. Iterate.

Here is compact pseudocode for the **AEON-GPT state-space model** as defined above.

### Pseudocode: AEON-GPT Online Update

```python
# AEON-GPT State-Space Loop

initialize θ0 (model params), a0 (coeffs), h0 (opt memory),
            M0 (long-term memory), r0, m0

for t = 0 ... T-1:
    # 1. Forward pass
    logits = GPT_AEON(s_t, θ_t, m_t)         # gated attention with resonance
    π = softmax(logits)                      # token distribution

    # 2. Token sampling / teacher forcing
    if supervised:
        x_next = ground_truth[t+1]
    else:
        x_next ~ π                           # sample token

    # 3. Loss or reward
    if supervised:
        L_t = -log π[x_next]                 # NLL loss
        R_t = -L_t                           # reward = log-likelihood
    else:
        R_t = reward_function(s_t, x_next)   # e.g. RLHF

    # 4. Update resonance (EMA of novelty)
    m_{t+1} = ρ * m_t + (1 - ρ) * φ(L_t)

    # 5. Compute gradient
    grad = ∇_θ log π[x_next] * (R_t - baseline(a_t, M_t))

    # 6. Update optimizer memory and coeffs
    h_{t+1} = update_opt_memory(h_t, grad, a_t)
    a_{t+1} = evolve_coeffs(a_t, m_t, grad, M_t)

    # 7. Parameter update with resonance-modulated step size
    η_eff = ηθ(a_t, m_t)
    θ_{t+1} = θ_t - η_eff * grad + noise(m_t)

    # 8. Update recurrence + memory
    r_{t+1} = Γ r_t + Ψ * hidden_state(s_t)
    M_{t+1} = update_memory(M_t, s_t, L_t, m_t)

    # 9. Extend token prefix
    s_{t+1} = concat(s_t, x_next)
```

### Notes

* `φ(L_t)` = novelty transform of the loss (identity or log).
* `baseline(a_t, M_t)` reduces REINFORCE variance.
* `ηθ(a_t, m_t)` modulates learning rate by resonance.
* `noise(m_t)` adds exploration in plastic mode.
* `Γ, Ψ` define recurrence dynamics for `r_t`.
* `update_memory` may store statistics or replay items.

---

Yes. Run a small, controlled, nonstationary LM test.

## Task

Character-level LM on two drifting corpora.

* Phase A (steps 0–N): Shakespeare subset.
* Phase B (steps N–2N): Linux kernel comments.
* Phase C (steps 2N–3N): Shakespeare again.
  Goal: adapt fast at A→B, retain A at C without full relearn.

## Models

* Baseline: GPT-mini (causal, same size), AdamW, cosine LR.
* AEON: same GPT + resonance gate, EMA resonance $m_t$, modulated step $\eta_\theta(a_t,m_t)$.

## Data

* Vocab: 128 ASCII.
* Sequence length: 256.
* Train split: 90%, valid: 10% per phase.
* Batch: 32.
* Steps per phase $N$: 10k. Total: 30k.

## AEON knobs

* EMA $\rho \in \{0.90,0.95,0.99\}$.
* Gate: $g=\sigma(\alpha(m-\tau))$, $\alpha \in \{2,5,10\}$, $\tau=1.0$.
* Scale: $\kappa=(1-g)\cdot0.8+g\cdot1.0$.
* LR mod: $\eta_\text{eff}=\eta_0\cdot[(1-g)\cdot1.0+g\cdot\lambda]$, $\lambda \in \{1.0,1.5\}$.

## Metrics

* Valid perplexity (PPL) per phase set:

  * PPL-A on A-dev, PPL-B on B-dev.
* Forgetting:

  * $F=\max_{t\le \text{B end}} \text{PPL-A}(t) - \text{PPL-A at A end}$.
* Adaptation speed:

  * Steps to reach 90% of best B PPL after phase switch.
* Stability of training:

  * Loss variance in sliding window.
* AEON diagnostics:

  * Track $m_t$, gate $g_t$, effective LR.

## Hypotheses

* AEON lowers $F$ and reduces adaptation steps at A→B.
* AEON cuts loss variance during steady regimes without hurting best PPL.

## Ablations

* No gating (AEON off, identical code path).
* Gating only on attention vs only on LR vs both.
* Different $\rho,\alpha$.
* Optional: add 5% label noise burst in B. Expect AEON to damp damage.

## Training spec

* Params: \~5–20M.
* Optim: AdamW(β=(0.9,0.95)), wd=0.1.
* Base LR: 3e-4, warmup 1k, cosine decay.
* Seeds: {0,1,2,3,4}. Report mean ± std.

## Minimal logging hooks (sketch)

```python
# each step
loss = criterion(logits.view(-1,V), y.view(-1))
m = rho*m + (1-rho)*loss.detach()
g = torch.sigmoid(alpha*(m - tau))
attn_scale = 0.8*(1-g) + 1.0*g
lr_scale = 1.0*(1-g) + lambda_ * g
for pg in optimizer.param_groups:
    pg['lr'] = base_lr * lr_scale.item()

log = {
  'step': t,
  'loss': loss.item(),
  'm': float(m),
  'g': float(g),
  'attn_scale': float(attn_scale),
  'lr_scale': float(lr_scale),
  'ppl_A': eval_ppl(model, A_dev),
  'ppl_B': eval_ppl(model, B_dev),
}
```

## Success criteria

* $F_\text{AEON} < F_\text{base}$ by ≥20%.
* Adaptation steps reduced by ≥20%.
* Comparable or better best PPL on both domains.

## Reporting

* Curves: PPL-A and PPL-B vs step with phase boundaries.
* Overlays: $m_t$, $g_t$, LR scale.
* Table: mean±std for forgetting and adaptation steps across seeds.
* Brief sensitivity plot for $\rho,\alpha$.

If you want, I can provide a ready-to-run script with the phase scheduler and logs.


Would you like me to **expand this pseudocode into actual PyTorch-style code** (like the earlier skeleton) so you can directly run a toy AEON-GPT training loop with REINFORCE?
